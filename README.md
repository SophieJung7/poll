# Poll Assignment

## App Instruction

- npm install
- npm run start

## Landing Page

- If you click the thumbnails, you can move to Poll Page.
- I couldn't finish the voting fuction. Instead, when you click 'Yes' or 'No', you can see the answer ID inside console.

## Voting Results DB

- At PollsList.js, I used state to initialize the voting results data.
- At PollPage.js, I made pollResults.json file and initialized the selected poll result in constructor.
